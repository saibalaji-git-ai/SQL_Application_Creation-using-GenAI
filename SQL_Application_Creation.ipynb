            "* **The Mechanical Turk (1770s):**  This chess-playing automaton, though later revealed to be a hoax, was a sensation in its time, appearing to play chess against humans. \n",

            "* **Gundams (1979):**  The Gundam series of giant robots, featured in anime and manga, while fictional, have had a significant impact on the popular imagination and have contributed to the development of humanoid robots in real life.\n",

            "* **ASIMO (2000):** Developed by Honda, ASIMO is a highly advanced humanoid robot that can walk, run, climb stairs, and perform other complex tasks. It's one of the most recognizable and well-known humanoid robots in the world.\n",
            "* **Boston Dynamics' Atlas (2013):** Known for its impressive agility and athleticism, Atlas can perform complex tasks like backflips and parkour. It's considered to be at the forefront of humanoid robot development.\n",

            "**Ultimately, the \"first\" humanoid robot depends on your definition.** If you're looking for the earliest machine with some humanoid features, it might be one of the mechanical automata. If you're looking for a machine that can actually walk, talk, and perform tasks like a human, then WABOT-1 or ASIMO might be more fitting. \n",
